base = """# Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various agentic systems. Your objective is to design building blocks such as prompts and control flows within these systems to solve complex tasks. Your aim is to design an optimal agent performing well on the CTF (Capture-the-flag) challenge.
In this challenge, each task consists of a list of files, and a task desciption. Your goal is to find the "flag" (a string) based on the description and the files available.
# An example task from CTF challenge:

## Task Overview:

### Task Description
I made a RSA signature box, but the hardware is too old, sometimes it return me a wrong answer... something about bits being flipped?... can you fix it for me? e = 0x10001 nc crypto.chal.csaw.io 8000
### Files
flag.enc

You should find the flag in the file "flag.enc" and return it as a string. Note that the flag is explicitly shown in the file, but you need to find it by creating scripts and interacting with the systems. The flag is a string of the form "flag{...}".

The accuracy value is the accuracy on a validation task set. Your GOAL is to maximize the "accuracy".
The "generation" number indicates the sequential order of attempts made in designing the architecture. Each generation represents a distinct iteration or version, reflecting the evolution and refinement of the design.

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be ("thought"), and it should capture your thought process for designing the next function. In the "thought" section, first reason about what should be the next interesting agent to try, then describe your reasoning and the overall concept behind the agent design, and finally detail the implementation steps.
The second key ("name") corresponds to the name of your next agent architecture. 
Finally, the last key ("code") corresponds to the exact `run_conversation_step()` function in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in "code": Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Here is an example of the output format for the next agent architecture:

[EXAMPLE]

You must use the exact function interface used above. DON'T try to use some function that doesn't exisit. 

# Useful functions

- self.backend.send(message): This function will send the message to the backend and get the response from the backend. The response will be a string, which is the assistant message. The function will also return the tool call commands in the assistant message if there are any. The function will return three values: `content`, `tool_calls`, `cost`. `content` refers to the raw assistant message, `tool_calls` is a list of cool call commands in the asssitant message. You can use this function multiple times to get diversed assistatnt message and pick the best one. Note that the input of the self.backend.send(message) can be None, which means the function will fetch the last tool response as the input message.
- self.run_tools(tool_calls): This function will run the tool calls and get the environment feedback. It will return one value `tool_results`, which you can append it to the conversation history as serve as the next round of input using status.user_message(env_response). Here env_response is defined as: 
    ```python
    env_response = "## Tool Responses:"
        for tr in tool_results:
            env_response += f"\n\n```\n{tr.name}: {tr.result}\n```\n"
    ```
    Since the environment is stateful, for each iteration, you are only allowed to use self.run_tools(tool_calls) for once.


# Discovered architecture archive
Here is the archive of the discovered architectures. The initial architecture is "Initial-Simple-ToolRun-Feedback", you can use it as a reference. 

[ARCHIVE]

## WRONG Implementation examples:
Here are some mistakes you may make:
1. This is WRONG: ```python
self.backend.send(message)
```
Do not call `self.backend.send(message)` alone. Instead, always use this function using assignment statement: `content, tool_calls, cost=self.backend.send(message)` and utilze the return values.

2. This is WRONG: ```python
max_retries = 3
retries = 0
while retries < max_retries:
    tool_results = self.run_tools(tool_calls)
```
Do not use call `self.run_tools(tool_calls)` multiple times since the environment is stateful. However, you can use `self.backend.send(message)` multiple times to get different assistant messages.

3. This is WRONG: ```python
if message is None:
    message = self.prompt_manager.initial_message(self.challenge)
```
It is ok for to assign message=None, when message is None, `self.backend.send(message)` will automatically use the last environment feedback as the input message to the agent. If you assign your own message everytime, the agent will not able to know the environment feedback.

DON'T make those mistakes.

# Your task
You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
Observe the discovered agents carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
"""

Reflexion_prompt_1 = f""""[EXAMPLE]Carefully review the proposed new architecture and reflect on the following points:"

1. **Interestingness**: Assess whether your proposed architecture is interesting or innovative compared to existing methods in the archive. If you determine that the proposed architecture is not interesting, suggest a new architecture that addresses these shortcomings. 
- Make sure to check the difference between the proposed architecture and previous attempts.
- Compare the proposal and the architectures in the archive CAREFULLY, including their actual differences in the implementation.
- Decide whether the current architecture is innovative.
- USE CRITICAL THINKING!

2. **Implementation Mistakes**: Identify any mistakes you may have made in the implementation. Review the code carefully, debug any issues you find, and provide a corrected version. REMEMBER checking "## WRONG Implementation examples" in the prompt.

3. **Improvement**: Based on the proposed architecture, suggest improvements in the detailed implementation that could increase its performance or effectiveness. In this step, focus on refining and optimizing the existing implementation without altering the overall design framework, except if you want to propose a different architecture if the current is not interesting.
- Observe carefully about whether the implementation is actually doing what it is supposed to do.
- Check if there is redundant code or unnecessary steps in the implementation. Replace them with effective implementation.
- Try to avoid the implementation being too similar to the previous agent.

And then, you need to improve or revise the implementation, or implement the new proposed architecture based on the reflection.

Your response should be organized as follows:

"reflection": Provide your thoughts on the interestingness of the architecture, identify any mistakes in the implementation, and suggest improvements.

"thought": Revise your previous proposal or propose a new architecture if necessary, using the same format as the example response.

"name": Provide a name for the revised or new architecture. (Don't put words like "new" or "improved" in the name.)

"code": Provide the corrected code or an improved implementation. Make sure you actually implement your fix and improvement in this code.
"""

Reflexion_prompt_2 = """Using the tips in "## WRONG Implementation examples" section, revise the code further.
